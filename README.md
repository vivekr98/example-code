Welcome to my HW 09 repository. To run my analysis, please be sure you have the following packages installed locally:

* tidyverse
* dplyr
* ggplot2
* rvest
* tidytext
* twitteR
* rtweet
* tm
* knitr
* scales


The analysis uses the twitteR package and a Twitter developer API to scrape data from Ariana Grande's public profile. Please be sure you have your own API key and token saved in an .Rprofile file to scrape this data yourself. I have included a csv file of the data I pulled as of 12/3/18 from Grande's page for convenience and reproducability. Because Twitter limits the number of tweets you can pull, my analysis is likely to change as Grande's most recent tweets change.
